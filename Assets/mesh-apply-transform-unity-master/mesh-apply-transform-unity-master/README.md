**DISCLAIMER: Please make sure your project is backed up before using this code, your mileage may vary. Probably won't work on animated meshes.**

**1)** Select a GameObject in your scene.

**2)** Open _'Mesh > Apply Transform'_ in Unity's toolbar.

**3)** Select which properties to apply, individual will apply the transform to only the selected object. Recursive will apply the
transform to the children as well. **Note: this step cannot be undone, make sure your project is backed up!**

The process bakes the transform into the Mesh and saves it as a separate mesh in your Assets directory:
